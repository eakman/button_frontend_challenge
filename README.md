# Button Coding Challenge

## JELL-O-CUBE
for my project, I built an audio visualizer that I call JELL-O-CUBE. Using the Web Audio API, J-O-C takes the audio input from your computer's microphone and sends it through an [AnalyserNode](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AnalyserNode), which provides real-time time-domain analysis of the inputted signal. It then takes the audio data and contorts the vertices of the cube, which was built using [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) - an open source 3D graphics library built on top of WebGL.
