# Button Coding Challenge

## JELL-O-CUBE
for my project I built an audio visualizer that I call JELL-O-CUBE. Using the Web Audio API, JELL-O-CUBE takes the audio input from your computer's microphone and sends it through an [AnalyserNode](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AnalyserNode). The AnalyserNode provides real-time time-domain analysis of the inputted signal. The resulting data is used to contort the cube's vertices. The cube itself was built using [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) - an open source 3D graphics library built on top of WebGL.

I think you at Button will love JELL-O-CUBE because it's neat usage of some of the browsers latest audio processing and graphics features.
